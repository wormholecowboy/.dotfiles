1. I'm not sure what you mean by this. Explain. 
2. remove extraneous
3. set max to 4
4. add suggested event
6. tell me more
7. I'm not sure if I can use FZF Lua for work trees and Harpoon, but you can do a web search to find out for me. 
11. I am interested in a test runner. I'm particularly interested in being able to hit one button, like F8, that can run all tests in the current project that I'm in. Either looking at the Git project running all tests, or running all tests within the module that I'm in. Tell me a little bit about how that works with NeoVim.
