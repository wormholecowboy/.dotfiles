Initial agent scan completed via `*init` command. Built comprehensive plugin index (43+ plugins catalogued), established baseline memory of user preferences and patterns. Configuration architecture documented: lazy.nvim with 9 primary plugin categories, modern LSP patterns (LspAttach autocmd), dual fuzzy finding (telescope + fzf-lua), extensive git tooling, and manual formatting workflow. Key insights: minimalist philosophy, keyboard-driven workflow, git-centric development, writing mode for prose. No new plugins installed - strictly read-only scan as specified.
