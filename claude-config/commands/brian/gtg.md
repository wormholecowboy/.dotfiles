description: Update any currently used plan and/or state files

I have to go. Update any state/planning files that you may be using for this convesation. Track any open questions, unknowns, things completed, next steps, etc. Make it easy to pick up where we left off. 

If you are not currently using a file to track progress, prompt the user to create one, such as using ./state-create.md
