description: Create a git commit for all uncommitted changes with conventional commit message
---

Create a new commit for all of our uncommitted changes
run git status && git diff HEAD && git status --porcelain to see what files are uncommitted
add the untracked and changed files
add a tag such as "feat", "fix", "docs", etc. that reflects our work
Create multiple commits if necessary for different work.
