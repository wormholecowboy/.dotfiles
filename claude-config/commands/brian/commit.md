description: Create a git commit for the changes we made in this conversation
---

Use the **git-ops** subagent (via Task tool) to create a detailed git commit.

Instructions for the subagent:
- Create a commit for the changes made in this conversation
- Keep it specific to the changes we made (not all uncommitted changes)
- Use conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Include appropriate scope if applicable
