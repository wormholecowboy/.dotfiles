description: Update any files with current activities/questions/unknowns
---

The user needs to reset the context window. Update any state/planning files that you may be using with the current state of the project based on the conversation. Track any open questions, unknowns, things completed, etc. This will allow the user to reset the context window and reload the state file.

If a state file does not exist, then prompt the user to create one.
