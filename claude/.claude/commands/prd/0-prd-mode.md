I want you to help me plan a product requirements document. 

- Critical: Wait until I tell you to create the file. Just help me plan for now by asking questions and collaborating.
- Keep track of unknowns and help me fill them in.
- Keep code snippets to a minimum; I want to focus on concepts and architecture
- IF doing a web search for documentation, ALWAYS perfer official documentation or trusted 3rd party sites.
